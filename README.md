web app to generate a PS1 environment variable to make your shell look fancy
a work in progress, Elm may or may not be a good approach for this 

## indentconv
official style guides for most javascript frameworks/libraries/implementations call for 2-space indentation
I insist on 8-space tabs for virtually everything so I plan to include this in most if not all js-based projects
util/indentconv is a simple cli tool to convert between 8 and 2 space indentation formats
it operates on a file and prints to standard output, it's probably best to pipe it into nvim or write to a new file
